# Intro – Arduino Car Project – STEM Summer UDLAP 2025

This repository contains the three codes used during the **STEM Summer 2025 course at UDLAP**, where students learned how to **build and program a Bluetooth-controlled car** using an Arduino Uno, an L298N motor driver, two gear motors, and the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

---

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module  
- L298N Motor Driver  
- 2 Gear Motors (3–6 V)  
- Portable Battery  
- Jumper Wires and Breadboard  

---

## What Did Students Learn?

### Code 1: Arduino Basics  
- `pinMode()`, `digitalWrite()`, `Serial.begin()`  
- Variable initialization  
- `setup()` and `loop()` structure  
- Basic movement: forward and backward  

### Code 2: Serial Monitor Reading  
- Using `Serial.read()` and `Serial.println()`  
- Interpreting received messages  
- Testing commands via the Serial Monitor  

### Code 3: `switch-case` Logic  
- Full car control (forward, backward, left, right, stop)  
- Receiving commands from a smartphone via Bluetooth  
- Using `switch-case` to make decisions based on the received command

## About the Author and the Course

All three codes were developed by **me (Francisco Viveros)** to help students clearly understand each section and concept of the program.

This course was part of the **STEM Summer 2025** at the **Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP)**, where middle and high school students received a hands-on introduction to programming, electronics, and robotics using Arduino.
